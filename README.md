### Configuration

It looks for an API-Key in the variable `YT_API_KEY` in your `process.env.` You can either export one or depending on your setup, put a `.env` file with the key:
-   into the `dist` folder
- or next to the `.AppImage` file
The  key will then be loaded automatically on start

You can generate an API-Key at the
[Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) it just needs to have access to the **YouTube Data API v3**.
